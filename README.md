# Simple-Calculator-1.0
Simple calculator I made long ago during my classes. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Simple UI

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator-1.0.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the calculator.

## That's all. :)
